Contributing
============

We appreciate contributions to our open source projects.

We use github issues to track our plans for our software. Feel free to volunteer to solve any of these.

BiteSize issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We also have some issues marked as being easy to get started with - the ``Bitesize`` label.

These currently only exist for 

* the dashboard - https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Dashboard/issues?labels=Bitesize&page=1&state=open
* the validator - https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Public_Validator/issues?labels=Bitesize&page=1&state=open
