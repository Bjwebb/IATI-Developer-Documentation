IATI Developer Community
========================

Background
----------

A focus on community has long been an aspiration for IATI. The desire for this was reiterated at the TAG meeting in Canada (Feb 2014), as it was at the previous meeting in Cookham a few years previously. Adrian Collier is now volunteering as Community Manager, and John Adams is now the TAG Chair.

The 'Developer Community' is a subset of the broader IATI community with it's own specific needs. The IATI technical team is well positioned to help develop, support and drive this community. Our working methods are already fairly open, but the team recognises that there is room for improvement and that more could be done to pro-actively engage other developers.

Who are the developers?
-----------------------

They may be data users and/or data publishers, but generally they are the 'coders' that work with IATI data. This is a technical audience.

Why build a developer community?
--------------------------------

Simply because we believe we can help each other. The tasks that we are all engaged with involve some crossover in terms of effort, problems faced and solved, and plans for the future. By being more open about the work we are engaged with, actively communicating, and sharing our work, we should all be able to widen the adoption and use of IATI data, and get our work done!

If we build it, will they come?
-------------------------------

Yes and no. While there is some infrastructure in place, we already know it is not sufficient. Community engagement has not been a large priority, and we have had some feedback from developers asking for things to be better, and asking for ways to be more involved.

What's already in place?
------------------------

* `IATI GitHub account <https://github.com/IATI/>`__ - has our code, our issues, and our milestones
* `Google Group <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/iati-technical>`__ - there is a mailing list in place
* `Wiki <http://wiki.iatistandard.org/>`__ - our wiki, while not without problems is a place for collaboration
* `IATI Standard website <http://iatistandard.org>`__ - has some documentation about the standard, but is not developer specific
* `Data Tickets <http://data.tickets.iatistandard.org/>`__ - a place to report problems with data
* `Data Dashboard <http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/>`__ - our project to try to get an overview of the figures that help us get our work done.

We recognise that some of the services above need love and attention or re-thinking completely.

In addition the following could happen now...

Each Week we...
---------------

* run an open IRC channel during our work hours - #iati on Freenode
* have a weekly informal 'stand-up' on #iati IRC (Thursdays 3pm London time) - a definite time to find us to be in IRC land and to say what we are working on. (The stand-up should be logged, and any relevant information written up and passed back to the technical list.)
* send a weekly email on Wednesday lunchtime "this week in IATI". This includes a call to join the weekly standup.
* wite a blog post (http://iati.github.io/ ) - Steven, David, Ben,  (Kriss/Shi) should take it in turns to write a weekly blog post on the past weeks events.

Documentation
-------------

We will build Developer Documentation using the same approach as the SSOT - this means taking material from the wiki and slowly closing that down, and building better documentation specifically targeted at developers. We should also link more prominently to our developer documentation that we currently do to the wiki. This would also then be available on the iatistandard.org website. See http://iatistandard.org/developer/

Each software project in our `GitHub Organisation repositories <https://github.com/IATI>`_ should have information for developers about how they can be involved in that project. 

Code
----

Bitesize issues - there should be small, simple issues that are flagged for new developers to have a go at. This gets them used to our ways of working, helps us fix minor things, and helps developers become familiar with the software.

Data Quality
------------

People have been great at reporting data quality issues to the technical team. We hope this continues.   
However we do not have the resources to fix everything. Our current approach is to use Data Tickets - http://data.tickets.iatistandard.org/  as a place to report issues, and to use the Dashboard to help us monitor and work with data issues. 

Feeding into other structures
-----------------------------

* Questions, feedback, ideas from the developer community should be fed into weekly IATI team meetings/calls. How we recording those requests, questions, and the responses should be considered.
* The Developer Community should be an agenda item at Quarterly IATI Tech Team meetings. There could be an opportunity for direct representation at such meetings.
* The Developer Community should be seen as a subset of the Technical Advisory Group. As such future TAG meetings may need to take this groups needs into account.
* There should be a Developer Community manager role. This does not necessarily mean a new post, but it is a role with specific duties. Again, the Developer Community should be seen as a subset of any other 'community engagement' ideas.


Developer Meetups
-----------------

While currently we have no resources identified to enable these, we think any feature of a developer community is that there are opportunities to meet in person.   
These could be locally - there could be one in the Netherlands, one in London, etc IATI Tech team don't need to be at them all, but could perhaps skype in.


Features of an active community
-------------------------------

We would hope to see:

* Increased registration at data.tickets and more tickets from different users
* More pull requests from more users on GitHub
* More issues created on GitHub by different users
* More activity on the Google Group
* Better engagement in change control processes
* More questions to be answered on a technical level
* A reduction in complaints that people don't know what we are doing, what our priorities our, or about what we are planning to work on.
* Increased re-use of our code by developers for their own use.
